<!-- ### Please note!
Yeah I know what you thinking... </br>
were are the files? and What happend here? </br>
so I have a answer for you (you may not like it...). </br>
I don't like the fact that everyone can just come take my hard work and copy it... so right now there is no files execpt the apk of the app. </br>
I really want to keep my project safe... </br>
Enjoy the app... </br>
